# Semicolon;

### **Where every line of code tells a story.**

## 🚀 Revolutionizing DSA Learning

**Forget LeetCode. Forget Codeforces.**

Traditional platforms present you with abstract puzzles: "Invert a binary tree," "Find the shortest path in a graph," or "Rotate an array." While these sharpen your raw algorithmic skills, they often miss the most critical question in software engineering:

**"Why? Where do we actually use this?"**

Semicolon is different. We don't just give you an algorithm; we give you a **Production Challenge**.

## 🌍 The Semicolon Philosophy

We believe that Data Structures and Algorithms are not just interview hurdles—they are the building blocks of scalable, efficient systems.

- **Don't just rotate an array.** Build a **Load Balancer** that distributes traffic evenly across servers.
- **Don't just implement a hash map.** Design a **Rate Limiter** to protect your API from potential abuse.
- **Don't just sort a list.** Optimize a **Database Index** to reduce query time from 5s to 50ms.
- **Don't just move pointers.** Write a **Disk Defragmenter** to organize fragmented storage blocks.

Semicolon gives every problem a **Real-World Use Case**, bridging the gap between theoretical computer science and practical software engineering.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Context-First Engineering
Every challenge starts with a scenario. You aren't just writing a function; you are fixing a bottleneck, preventing an outage, or optimizing a critical service.

### 2. Interactive Visualizations
See your code come to life. Watch requests flow through your load balancer, see the database scan rows, and observe the disk blocks reorganizing in real-time.

### 3. System Design Integration
Learn how low-level algorithmic decisions impact high-level system architecture. Understand the trade-offs between time complexity and system resources.
